# Product Recommendation using Graph Database - Neo4j

In this project, we use the graph database Neo4j to enhnace product recommendations and offers for our customers. Neo4j is a highly scalable, graph database management system, which is a purpose-built database to store and navigate relationships in computing. It stores nodes and relationships instead of tables or documents in a graph structure for semantic queries.

We have the following user stories that articulate how our work will deliver value back to the customer:
•	As a customer, Thomas wants relevant book recommendations whenever he buys a book from the App. 
•	As a customer, Annie would like the App to show personalised recommendations based on what other similar customers are buying. 
•	The customer Nicola would like to see some product discounts /offers based on her recent likes and views on the App.
